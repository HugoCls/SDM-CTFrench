# SDM-CTFrench

Hello, welcome to our CTF called CTFrench.

The objective of CTFrench is to leverage our knowledge of mobile and computer security to create Capture The Flag (CTF)-like challenges covering various security topics. These challenges will be designed for both iOS and Android platforms, offering participants an opportunity to explore and understand the security aspects of both environments. Additionally, we plan to develop a hosted verification platform where participants can submit flags obtained from the challenges for scoring.

The flag format is `FLAG=CTFrench{[FLAG_NAME]}`.
