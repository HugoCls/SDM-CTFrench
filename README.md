## Objective:
The objective of CTFrench is to leverage our knowledge of mobile and computer security to create Capture The Flag (CTF)-like challenges covering various security topics. These challenges will be designed for both iOS and Android platforms, offering participants an opportunity to explore and understand the security aspects of both environments. Additionally, we plan to develop a hosted verification platform where participants can submit flags obtained from the challenges for scoring.

## About the CTF:
CTFrench derives its name from a combination of "Capture The Flag" and "French". Each flag in the challenges will represent a French specialty or a French city. Participants who successfully discover all flags will uncover a humorous story about France and its culture, providing an entertaining and educational experience.

## Challenge Categories:
The challenges in CTFrench will encompass a diverse range of security topics, including but not limited to:
- **Steganography**: Participants will need to uncover hidden information within audio or image files.
- **Cryptography**: 1-2 challenges involving cryptographic puzzles or encryption/decryption techniques.
- **SQL Injection**: A challenge focused on exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities in a web application.
- **Binary Exploitation**: 2 or more challenges requiring static or dynamic analysis to exploit vulnerabilities in binary files.
- **Web**: 1 or more challenges focusing on web security, such as XSS or CSRF vulnerabilities.
- **Forensics**: A challenge involving forensic analysis to uncover hidden data or clues.
- **OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence)**: A challenge based on a French location, requiring participants to gather information from publicly available sources to uncover the flag.
