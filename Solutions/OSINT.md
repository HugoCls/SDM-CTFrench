# OSINT

## Introduction
Upon clicking on the button OSINT, we are redirected on a page with specific instruction on how to find the flag:

In this photo, the first legends of French skiing is about to cross the finish line and win his third world championship title this year. Can you find out his first and last name as well as the name of the city where these competitions took place?
The flag will like this: 
CTFrench{FirstName_LastName_TownName}
the first letter of each name being capitalized

and a blurry image of a skiier
## Walkthrough
To resolve this ctf, all we need is to dig some information on the internet.

For that, we need to find which french skiier has been 3 time world champion the same year.
We can notice that the picture is blurry and old so the best thing is to check the records of french skiing champion

It is easy to find the person we are looking for:
Emile Allais in Chamonix

Flag: **CTFrench{Emile_Allais_Chamonix}**
